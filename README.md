# HoloLens Collaborative Sandbox v 2.0

This project is being created by a group with an eye for UX and HoloLens. 

The goal here is for the community to work together in building a plugin for Unity, with the 
result of simplify the development process of good UX-design. 

Before we can start the plugin the Community needs to decide what best practices need to be implemented by building and sharing UX ideas.

If you are contributing and would like to demonstrate a style of design, create your own scene and add it to the project.
 For now, avoid stepping on others code, at least until we get into the plugin development. Then likely it will be impossible.

If you have interest in joining in join us on the Slack Server.
